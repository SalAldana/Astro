# Astro

Astro is a sample application the is meant to demonstrate a very opinionated approach to developing a cross platform application for viewing Sunrise/Sunset information for a selected Date and Location, written as a learning project. 

The goal of this project is to show an end to end process from taking a small idea and turning it into a fully functional application. This app will cover some of the current frameworks and technologies that are available for each platform including; SwiftUI for iOS, Jetpack Compose for Android, and Svelte for the Web App. 



## Common Resources

In order to make this project easier to develop, and present, some of the shared resources were adjusted. This leaves room for you to change or add different features. 

-   [World Cities Location](https://github.com/fulvio999/world_city_location_times) - There are numerous paid resources available that contain more data, but for this project I found a free, smaller, database that already had the timezone added to each location. 
-   [City Kit](https://www.startupmilk.com/city-kit) - A great set of Illustrations, only San Francisco was used for this project. 



##  ðŸ¤” Where to go now

All of the projects are working applications that you can use as-is, but there is plenty of room for growth if you want to try and go even further. Some ideas of what can be added to the project: 

1. Device Location - Implementing permission to get the Users Location (for the mobile apps) and allow them to use their location as well with the bundled locations
2. Add more Phases - There are some more phases in the day that people like (for example Golden Hour) so try adding some more phases from the sunCalc library
3. City Images - Only one city was included, but there's room to show different cities or images for different locations
